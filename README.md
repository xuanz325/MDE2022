Implementation of MQTT Client using ESP32 in Arduino IDE
ESP32 and MQTT can be used together to develop IoT applications using the Arduino IDE. Here's a brief overview of how ESP32 and MQTT work together in the Arduino IDE:
Install the required libraries: The first step is to install the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE. The ESP32 board support package and the PubSubClient library are the most commonly used libraries to develop ESP32 and MQTT applications in Arduino IDE. 
Connect to Wi-Fi network: The ESP32 needs to be connected to a Wi-Fi network to access the MQTT server. The ESP32 can connect to Wi-Fi using the Wi-Fi.h library in the Arduino IDE. 
Connect to MQTT broker: The PubSubClient library provides a simple and easy-to-use API for connecting to the MQTT broker. The MQTT broker's IP address, port, and credentials are passed as parameters to the MQTT client's connect() function. 
Publish and subscribe to MQTT topics: Once the ESP32 is connected to the MQTT broker, it can publish messages to MQTT topics using the publish() function and subscribe to topics using the subscribe() function. 
Handle incoming messages: When the ESP32 is subscribed to a topic, it can receive messages from the MQTT broker. The PubSubClient library provides a callback function that can be used to handle incoming messages.
